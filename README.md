- 👀 I’m interested in finding an understanding that our conscious experience of qualia and decision processing with the physical reality in the brain that
we can measure and then using this understanding to help mental health as well as get people to agree on truthful factual claims beyond inherent biases that make it difficult.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create diffusion map embeddings of the brain to see how information is transferred between parts in different conscious states 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything similar to my interests
